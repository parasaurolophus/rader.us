Over the years I have used a variety of traditional
instruments and electronic gear to make, er, um, "music?"
Yes, let's call it "music."

## Approaches & Techniques

My process for creating music has evolved as new technologies have become
available, but conceptually is not all that different from how I [started
out](./yesterday.md) as a composer. I have loved listening to many types of
music all my life. The first album that I bought with my "own" money was a
recording of Schubert's _Unfinished Symphony_. I had worn the grooves out of it
by the time I turned seven years old. By the time I was in my late teens, I was
writing papers for my degree in Formal Linguistics and, a couple of years later,
teaching myself to program computers while listening to a personal soundtrack
that featured Lou Reed's _Metal Machine Music_ -- yes, the 4-LP sides' worth of
guitar feedback and effects noise that ended his career just as it was starting
to take off in the late 1970's. You will find strong hints of all those
influences - classical and experimental music together with mathematics and a
love of algorithms - throughout my musical _oeuvre_. To me, an analog
synthesizer is a device for translating what are essentially mathematical
formulas into acoustic impulses, which are occasionally and serendipitously
esthetically pleasing (at least to someone with my extremely idiosyncratic
tastes). Computer software makes that even more literally true.

and MIDI sequencer all at the same time.
