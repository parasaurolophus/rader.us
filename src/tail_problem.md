## What Is Computability and What Has It Got to Do with Anything?

Computability Theory is a branch of mathematics that was briefly of intense interest to mathematicians in the early-to-mid 20th Century. Its two leading figures, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, produced results that settled the specific question, "what makes a number computable?" In doing so, they ushered in the post-industrial "information age" because Turing's approach using thought experiments involving finite-state automata (popularly known as "Turing Machines") became the blueprint for modern digital computer hardware while Church's Lambda Calculus became the blueprint for all computer programming languages.

But what does the question about "computability" even mean? And why is it a question that still should be asked in the context of fields like Qunatum physics?

First, some history.


### How Real Is a Number That Cannot Be Computed?

The last point made above is crucial. There is no question that Cantor's, Goedel's, Church's and Turing's arguments are valid. But remember that mathematical validity provides no guarantee regarding empirical reality. The idea of the "real number line" is very deeply ingrained in mathematical thinking in the Western tradition. Computability Theory's whole motivation stems from the assumption that the real number line is continuous and infinitely subdividable. In this model, each and every dimensionless point on the line corresponds to exactly one real number and between any two dimensionless points, no matter how close they are together, there are infinitely many more dimensionless points representing additional, unique real numbers.

While this works perfectly well for the purposes of "pure" mathematics whose only concern is validity, it does not take much understanding of chemistry and physics to know that such a number line cannot be a physical object. Any such object would be composed of some material. That material would be composed of some combination of molecules. Each molecule would be composed of some combination of atoms. Each atom would be composed of members of the "particle zoo" comprised of fermions, bosons, hadrons, the latter of which would be composed of quarks (and, unless something like M-Theory could ever be proven, that is as far as current understanding goes). The point is that there is a limit to the divisability of any physical substance. Divide a physical representation of the number line enough times, and it stops being the object with which you started and if this process of subdivision is continued far enough the whole thing dissovles into a cloud of "elementary" particles (and, probably, a mushroom cloud hovering over a zone of total destruction).

Similarly, no non-computable number could correspond to a measurable state of any physical object. No matter how high the resolution of some detection apparatus, it will be designed to test some hypothesis using engineering approaches both of which are bound to computable numbers. But remember the core insight of Qunatum physics: physical systems jump directly from quantum state to quantum state without passing through a continuum of states in between. If that is true, and no quantum state could ever be detected whose representation required use of a non-computable number, how would we ever know _and why should we even suspect_ that some of those states correspond to values that fall between the cracks of computable numbers? And if non-computable numbers cannot be detected physically nor characterized mathematically why should we take them seriously?

## The "Tail Problem"

Which brings us to one of the many supposed metaphysical challenges posed by Quantum Physics. Since phenomena at the quantum level are governed by probability, the assumption made by physicists trained in the Western tradition is that such probabilities have infinitely long "tails" -- there is always some chance, no matter how small, of some spectacularly unexpected state transition. But this view is based in part on the idea of the infinitely subdividable real number line and thus on the idea that non-computable numbers are real enough to have an effect that could be observed in the physical world. Computability Theory and Quantum Physics, itself, both suggest otherwise. If one assumes that numbers themselves are "quantized" (metaphorically, hence the quotes -- computable real numbers can still be regarded as "continuous" even if one dismisses the idea that a vast sea of non-computable values exist between every computable one) by their computability just as phyiscal systems are governed by quantized states, then the "tail problem" is greatly reduced. To compute a probability is to know its magnitude. While this by itself does not rule out very small probabilities, it does mean that definite calculations are possible without having to account, even conceptually, for any "wiggle room" left by the supposedly infinite number of non-computable probabilities between any two computable values which differ by minute magnitudes. Since macroscopic phenomena are composed of unimaginably vast agglomerations of particles for which quantum indeterminacy is relevant, sufficiently tiny probabilities by definition cancel one another out. If they did not, the calculations of the relative probabilities were simply incorrect to start with. At a very deep level, the laws of physics operate very similarly to casinos and government sponsored lotteries. At a casino, enormous jackpots are possible for any given player at any given moment but simply serve as cheap advertising when paid. The rate at which they are allowed to occur and the desired level of payout is baked into the probablity tables that drive the games and can easily be predicted far in advance. The "tail problem" is no different. Classical cause and effect is no more danger from quantum indeterminacy than a Vegas casino is in danger of going out of business because of too many jackpots in too short a time. In short, physicists would do well to leave metaphysics to the professionals in the Philosophy Department.
