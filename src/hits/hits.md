# A Selection of Less Outr&eacute; Music Tracks

At the request of some friends and family who have, rather incautiously,
requested access to some of my music without recourse to streaming services, I
have put together the following links. (These are all tracks from various
albums that are available on most music streaming services.)

The first eight are among my more accessible compositions. They are mostly
rather silly. They generally began life as ways of experimenting with
particular features of some new piece of music gear or audio software. I think
of them as aural palette cleansers.

1. [Analogy in C Minor](./01%20Analogy%20in%20C%20Minor.mp3)
2. [Digitalis in C Minor](./02%20Digitalis%20in%20C%20Minor.mp3)
3. [Ludwig van Synthpop](./03%20Ludwig%20van%20Synthpop.mp3)
4. [E Minor Tune](./04%20E%20Minor%20Tune.mp3)
5. [segnahC cigaM](./05%20segnahC%20cigaM.mp3)
6. [Farandole Lamentoso (2600)](./06%20Farandole%20Lamentoso%20-%202600.mp3)
7. [Farandole in Tempore Belli](./07%20Farandole%20in%20Tempore%20Belli.mp3)
8. [Analogy in C Major](./08%20Analogy%20in%20C%20Major.mp3)

The remaining tracks are more representative of the vast majority of my musical
(yes, I consider these musical) output. Not necessarily more "serious," but
definitely an acquired taste.
