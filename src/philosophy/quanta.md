# Quantum Physicists Just Need to Get Over It

Almost daily, in certain corners of the media, yet another blog post, TV show,
book or pop-sci magazine article is full of breathlessly overblown descriptions
of how weird and brain-breaking Quantum Physics is including quotes from
Professional Physicists explaining how Everything We Believe About the Nature of
Reality Is Wrong!

Let's all just calm down.

A century ago, when the field of Quantum Physics was new and burgeoning,
physicists might have been excused for reacting to its discoveries with shock
and even disbelief. It took no lesser mind than that of Albert Einstein, who had
pioneered the idea of treating photons as quanta of light, quite a while to
fully internalize some of Quantum Physics impossible-to-predict-in-advance
results, particularly indeterminacy and entanglement. But consider that Einstein
along with the originators of Quantum Mechanics like Bohrs were born firmly
within the Victorian Age. Universal electrification of cities was still a work
in progress when they were students. Steam power was still in use in non-trivial
ways when they were working at the height of their intellectual powers.

But what is so shocking, really? It turns out that billiard balls are made out
of stuff at the sub-atomic level that does not behave exactly like a bunch of
little tiny billiard balls. Stop the presses! Reality doesn't exist!

Would it not have been more surprising and metaphysically disturbing if the
"particles" of particle physics actually did behave substantially like, well,
particles? That would suggest an infinite regress of sub-sub-sub-atomic
particles, each being very particle-like, to the power of \\(-\infty\\) and that
really would be hard to reconcile with common sense. As it is, chunks of
macroscopic matter have different properties than molecules, molecules have
different properties than atoms, atoms have different properties than protons,
neutrons and electrons which, in turn, have different properties than the rest
of the denizens of the "particle zoo." As physics advances, what counts as a
"fundamental" particle keeps changing: some particles formerly regarded as
fundamental turn out to be composed of even smaller particles like quarks (and
now, it seems, leptoquarks) with even stranger properties. But that does _not_
mean that it is accurate to regard a quark as being a little ball and a hadron
as being a bigger ball made of mashed-together quarks or an atom's nucleus being
a ball of protons and neutrons, each of which is a littler ball, being orbited
by a bunch of tiny balls, each of which is an electron, despite all those
diagrams you saw in school.

Consider that mechanical clocks are not just collections of gears of particular
sizes, springs of particular lengths and flexibility and so on. Clocks are
collections of such bits and pieces arranged in very specific ways and
maintained in a very particular state. Disassemble a clock and you have all the
pieces of which a clock can be made, but none of those pieces on their own look
or behave anything like a clock. You cannot tell time by looking at a pile of
gears and springs, even if that pile is a disassmbled clock. You especially
cannot tell time just using a single gear on its own.

Electrons are among the constituent bits and pieces out of which ordinary matter
is made. They are too tiny to see on their own and travel too fast for us to
follow as they whiz past (when viewed as "particles") or wash about (when viewed
as "waves"), but a bunch of very clever people have figured out ways to perform
hard-to-explain experiments measuring their actions and interactions. Human
brains working the way they do, even the most clever people need to start with
some sort of mental framework when trying to puzzle out completely new things.
So, of course, phycists who were steeped in classical mechanics &mdash; because
that is the only kind there was when science first became ready to tackle stuff
at the quantum level &mdash; started to categorize and interpret the results
they got when they started measuring the effects and properties of things like
electrons by analogy to classical mechanics. It is no surprise, then, that
physicists may detect particle-like and wave-like properties in things that are
neither particles nor waves using tools and techniques that can only ever
measure indirectly some specific aspect of a thing they can never, even in
principle, see exactly for what it is in the way we can literally see dust
particles or ocean waves.

A billiard ball resting on a level surface will sit in perfect stillness and
smug solidity when viewed at the scale at which human senses operate, right up
to the moment that some external force is applied that sends it rolling off in
some predictible direction, at some predictible speed, all according to Newton's
comfortably explicable laws. Because that is how well polished spheres of
lacquered wood behave. But dare zoom in far enough, pop-sci Physics warns, and
the ball is nothing but a tenuous, seething cloud of mere probability that
really should not be said to exist at all and is in danger at any moment of
dissolving into a gamma ray burst or teleporting itself onto the surface of the
moon. But is that not like saying that the old proverb about the blind men and
the elephant means that elephants do not really exist but only wall-like things,
and tree-like things, and rope-like things, and snake-like things?

A far more sensible way of regarding the supposed "weirdness" of Quantum Physics
is that electrons behave like electrons, protons like protons etc. just as
billiard balls behave like billiard balls. It is a metaphysical red herring
known as _reductionism_ to focus on the fact that the latter are made from the
former. Since we cannot see at the sub-atomic level directly, we perform
experiments and take measurements and construct mathematical models to describe
the results. When we make the mistake of taking our reasoning by analogy with
stuff we actually can see too seriously, our expectations are thwarted not
because the behavior of stuff at the sub-atomic level is inexplicably and even
threateningly different from the behavior of stuff made from that sub-atomic
stuff, any more than the "reality" of a clock is threatened by the fact that it
is made from parts that are, themselves, not at all clock-like. Stop talking or
thinking about sub-atomic particles as being particles and suddenly things seem
a lot less weird.

A corollary is that apparent paradoxes like the "tail problem" are not
particularly problematic after all. Supposedly, quantum indeterminacy means that
there is always some chance, even if only an ultra microscopically small chance,
of some physical object acting in some observably non-classical way. Ask any
casino operator: that is not how probability actually works. If it were, casinos
would go out of business. As it is, they love nothing better than to give out
giant jackpots because the marketing opportunities they represent are built into
their extremely profitable business model. Casinos know very well, in advance,
the limits to how much money they are going to give out over any given period of
time because their games of chance are designed to pay out at a certain rate
even while _not_ being rigged in the sense of outright cheating. The chance of a
casino going broke because it had to pay too many jackpots all at once is
transcendently higher than the chance of seeing some billiard ball start rolling
around on its own due to quantum indeterminacy. Do not hold your breath waiting
to see either of those events in the real world.

More signficantly, the "tail problem" looks at the indeterminacy of some state
of an individual particle and imagines that it somehow equates to even a very
small potential for indeterminacy at the macroscopic scale. But that relies on
math that treats probablities as points on the infinitely subdivisible number
line. That, in turn, ignores the quantum nature of reality, itself. The real
problem here is Physcists mistaking features of their mathematical models for
features of the stuff they are modeling. Yes, quantum indeterminacy is real. It
can lead to measurable effects that can be usefully applied in science and
engineering like quantum tunneling. No, that does not mean that there is some
metaphysical threat to the nature of reality nor that cause and effect are
illusory or provisional.

And then there is superposition and collapse. The way in which the "Copenhagen"
and "Many Worlds" interpretations are usually discussed is rather silly. The act
of observation, it is said, either causes the wave function to collapse such
that observation determines reality or wave functions never collapse such that
the universe is constantly boiling off into vast snarls of alternate histories
each with its own unique combination of quantum outcomes. As appealing as the
one is to mystics and the other to sci-fi authors, neither is at all necessary
nor plausible. Even taking the Bell Theorem into account and accepting the
experimental results confirming that there are no "hidden variables," there is a
difference between reality and knowledge about reality. Schr&ouml;dinger's cat
is doing just fine, thank you very much &mdash; unless, of course, she isn't.
That is because cats are not subject to quantum indeterminacy even if composed
of stuff that is. If you make her well-being contingent on the indeterminate
state of a quantum experiment (in a thought experiment! No cats were harmed in
the writing of this article!) the indeterminacy remains at the quantum level,
not at the level of the cat. The fact that we will not know whether the cat is
alive or dead until we open the box does not mean that opening the box caused
the cat's wave function to collapse, because wave functions do not actually have
anything to say about cats. Ultimately, the supposed ontological crisis implied
by the observer effect is just another example of taking the mathematical model
too seriously while applying it in a reductionist fashion.

[Though a digression, the same could be said about General Relativity and the
"problem" of "time's arrow." General Relativity is true enough that it can make
accurate predictions regarding astronomical observations like gravitational
lensing and time dilation must be accounted for by aerospace engineers working
on satellite based systems and the like. One of its basic premises is that time
is just another mathematically interchangeable dimension of spacetime along with
width, height and depth. But if that were all there were to say about time, then
the inexorable and unidirectional passage of time and our very different
experience of it compared to our experience of the other three dimensions of
spacetime seems to need explanation. Einstein famously quipped that the passage
of time is a "persistent illusion." Given his penchant for metaphor and sarcasm
("God does not play dice with the universe," "the definition of insanity is
performing the same experiment over and over and expecting different results"
and the like), there is no reason to doubt Einstein's sanity in this regard. I
imagine he was employing irony to point out that while his own mathematical
model allows us to treat spacetime usefully and effectively as a
four-dimensional plenum for the purposes of General Relativity, that cannot
actually be all there is to a complete understanding of the nature of time.
Attempts to supplement the reduction of space and time to spacetime with
reference to something like entropy to account for "time's arrow" do not help
and actually just highlight the real problem. Meta-mathematical models are by
definition reductionist and so can be relied upon to produce the kind of
"paradoxes" that arise when observations of the real world focus on phenomena
outside the domain of discourse of a given model. Einstein's model only looks at
time as a dimension of spacetime and does not even attempt to pull into its
description other properties of time that are not relevant to General
Relativity, in particular those properties that make it quite different from
spatial dimensions.]

In short, Physicists (really, pop-sci journalists) would do well to leave
Metaphysics to the professionals in the Philosophy Department. Ideally, they
will just get on with the business of calculating their wave functions and
conducting their experiments, letting the rest of us in on the interesting and
useful stuff they discover along the way without all the melodrama.
